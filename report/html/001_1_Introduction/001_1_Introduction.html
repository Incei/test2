<p>The presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of a PBPK model for atazanavir in healthy adults.</p>
<p>Atazanavir, sold under the trade name Reyataz among others, is an azapeptide protease inhibitor and used as antiretroviral medication to treat and prevent HIV/AIDS. It is taken orally once a day at a dose of 300 mg, if co-administered with ritonavir 100 mg orally once a day, and 400 mg, if administered without ritonavir. </p>
<p>After oral administration, atazanavir is rapidly absorbed. A positive food effect has been observed, atazanavir is recommended to be taken with food. Protein binding is relatively high (86%) and independent of the concentration of serum proteins (<a href="../input/references.md">US Food and Drug Administration 2002</a>). Atazanavir undergoes extensive metabolism by CYP3A isoenzymes with a dose fraction excreted unchanged in urine of approximately 7% (<a href="../input/references.md">US Food and Drug Administration 2002</a>, <a href="../input/references.md">Le Tiec 2005</a>). Previous in vitro studies suggest that atazanavir is a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A (<a href="../input/references.md">US Food and Drug Administration 2002</a>, <a href="../input/references.md">Perloff 2005</a>).</p>
<p>The atzanavir model is a whole-body PBPK model and is - together with the respective evaluation plan and PBPK report - transparently documented and provided open-source (https://github.com/AndreDlm/Atazanavir-Model).</p>
