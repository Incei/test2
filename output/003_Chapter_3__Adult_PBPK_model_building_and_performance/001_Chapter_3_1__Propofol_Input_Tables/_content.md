### Propofol model

Propofol, sold under the brand name Isentress, is an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV/AIDS by blocking the establishment of post-integration HIV latency . It is also used as part of post exposure prophylaxis, to prevent HIV infection following potential exposure. Raltegravir is only taken orally and is mainly metabolized by UGT1A1 (~70%) [1].  The final raltegravir model applies metabolism by UGT1A1, and minor involved enzyme UGT1A9 and glomerular filtration and adequately described the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir in adults.

The Propofol model was developed using data of the following publications:
